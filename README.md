# Overview :

The SMS Spam Classifier is a Machine learning project aimed at identifying and filtering out Spam messages from legitimate SMS text messages. This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a machine learning model to classify incoming text messages as either 'spam' or 'ham' (non-spam).

## Features :

1) Text Preprocessing : Tokenization, Stemming, and removal of stop words. 
2) Feature Extraction : Using techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical vectors. 
3) Model Evaluation : Naive Bayes is used and Assessing model performance using metrics like Accuracy and Precision. 
4) Deployment : Streamlit Framework is used for deploying the model, allowing users to input SMS messages and get predictions in real-time.
